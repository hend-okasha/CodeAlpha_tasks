# CodeAlpha Internship Projects

This repository contains three Java applications developed during my internship at CodeAlpha.  
Each project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming principles, clean structuring, and basic data persistence using File I/O.

The goal is to present well-organized Java projects that reflect real development practices.

## Included Projects

### 1. Student Grade Tracker  
A console system for adding students, recording grades, and generating performance summaries.  
*Example:*  
- Add a student named "Sara"  
- Enter her grades: 85, 90, 78  
- The system calculates: Average = 84.3, Highest = 90, Lowest = 78  

### 2. Stock Trading Platform  
A simplified simulation of a trading environment with price updates and portfolio tracking.  
*Example:*  
- AAPL starts at 175.50  
- After price fluctuation: 174.10  
- User buys 3 shares → Total cost calculated automatically  
- Portfolio is saved using File I/O  

### 3. Hotel Reservation System  
A room booking manager that handles reservations, cancellations, and room availability.  
*Example:*  
- User searches for “Deluxe” rooms  
- Books Room #204 for 3 nights  
- Reservation is stored in a file and can be viewed later

## Purpose
These projects were developed to strengthen Java problem-solving skills, explore OOP design patterns, and practice building structured, maintainable applications suitable for backend development.
